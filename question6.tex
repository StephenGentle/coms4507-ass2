\section{Given Information}
All teams were given a file: vpn-solution.zip\\
It contained a network diagram and the client/server OpenVPN configuration.
\\\\
For each of these areas we had to identify how the current configuration
implements these functions, identify weaknesses in the current configuration and
detail changes that would improve the security of the deployed solution.

\section{Mitigation Question 6.1}
