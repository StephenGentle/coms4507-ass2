\chapter{Question 6 - VPN Security Analysis}

\section{Preparation}
The process of setting up a VPN on our own hardware before the competition was
conducted for fun, to give us a platform on which to practice and also to help
use develop a better understanding of VPN configurations and setups for this
section. We spent almost a week wading through a huge amount of configuration
documentation and guides before ultimately putting the VPN together. 

\section{Given Information}
All teams were given a file: vpn-solution.zip\\
It contained a network diagram and the client/server OpenVPN configuration.
\\\\
For each of these areas we had to identify how the current configuration
implements these functions, identify weaknesses in the current configuration and
detail changes that would improve the security of the deployed solution.

\section{Mitigation Questions 6.1 - 6.5}
\subsection{Retrospective Approach}
We left this section far too late in the competition to be able to successfully
complete all the questions, starting on Q6.1 with a little over 90 minutes left.
This is likely because the scoring system seemed to put a higher importance on
retrieving flags than answering mitigation questions, so we focused most of our
efforts on flags instead. Doing it over again we would likely have spent more
time on these questions at a far earlier stage, as they were relatively easy to
answer, just time consuming to do so.

\section{Mitigation Question 6.1}
\textbf{Review how the current configuration implements authentication, identify
any weaknesses and detail changes that would improve the security of the
deployed solution}
