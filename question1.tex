\section{Question 1.1}
\textbf{Find the flag hidden in a secret document}
\subsection{Approach}
Although the question was (presumably intentionally) ambiguous in it's wording,
we guessed that it would be some sort of incorrect web server configuration,
allowing directory level browsing and hence detection of 'hidden' files. In
order to easily discover vulnerable ports and paths we ran a scan of the web
server with Nessus while we went and grabbed some lunch.

The scan took approximately 45 minutes to complete, and showed us that our
assumption was correct in that the web server allowed traversing through
directories. A quick manual search through available directories found a file
called secret.txt which contained the flag.
\subsection{Retrospective Approach}
We're confident that our approach was the optimal way to go about finding this
vulnerability. We could have instead acted on our assumption and begun looking
for directory paths manually or just scanned for them and nothing else but the
information from the Nessus scan was useful for many aspects of the competition
and if our assumption was wrong we could have wasted a lot of time better spent
elsewhere.
