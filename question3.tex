\section{Given Information}
There was a server running VSTP: 172.16.1.20 port 5678
\\\\
All teams were given the file: vstp-package.zip
It contained the VSTP package, which comprised of the following:
\\- VSTP RFC
\\- Server and Client - Python source code
\\- The server public key
\\- Test client private / public keys (Key password is "password")
\\- Binary Debian package
\\- Installation script and README (please read before use)
\\\\
We were also given an unprivileged login to the server (VSTP):\\
\textbf{Username:} testclient
\\
\textbf{Password:} !321Password
\\\\
There was a server running Snort IDS: 172.16.1.107
\\\\
We were also given an unprivileged login to the server (SSH):\\
\textbf{Username:} test
\\
\textbf{Password:} Password123

section{Question 3.1}
\textbf{There is a command injection vulnerability in the VSTP server code
