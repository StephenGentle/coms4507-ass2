\chapter{Abstract}

This report is a summary of the questions and tasks that the University of
Queensland 1 (UQ1) team answered in the recent Cyber Security Challenge
Australia (CySCA) competition, which was run jointly by Telstra and the
Defence Signals Directorate (DSD).

The team attempted questions from many sections of the competition, and
captured many of the flags. Overall, the team achieved twelfth place out of
forty-three teams.

In Question 1, the team captured two of the four flags, exploiting an
information disclosure vulnerability where a secret file was able to be found
because the server had directory listing enabled. The second flag involved
exploiting an SQL injection vulnerability in a sign-up script, which allowed
a user to be created that was already approved (as opposed to how it was
intended to work - requiring an administrator to approve all new accounts).

In Question 2, a corporate network was penetration tested. The team succeeded
in gaining access to a machine on the corporate network by creating a
malicious web site that contained a Java applet that exploited a vulnerability
in the outdated Java version installed. This enabled a saved password to be
stolen from the user's browser profile. Unfortunately, a privilege escalation
method was not found, so the subsequent flags were not able to be captured.

...

Overall, the challenge was extremely enjoyable, and all the members of the
group leant a great deal about computer security and penetration testing.
