\section{Given Information}
All teams were given a memory dump file prior to the competition: MEMORY.7z\\
We were given the decryption key to the file upon commencement of the
competition.

\section{Question 4.1}
\textbf{Identify the malicious process on the computer.
\\\\
a) What is the PID of the initial malicious process?
\\b) At what date and time did the malicious process initially execute?
\\c) What is the parent PID of the malicious process?
\\\\
Example answer format: [1234] [2010-01-23 23:34:56] [4321]}

\textbf{a) What IP address is the malicious process communicating with?
\\b) What is the name of the mutex used by the malicious process?
\\\\
Example answer format: [127.0.0.1] [mutex1]}

\section{Question 4.3}
\textbf{Locate and decode the key logger data file created by the malicious
process.\\
\\a) What is the file location of the key logger data file?
\\b) At what date and time was the key logger data file created?
\\\\
Example answer format:
[\textbackslash{}Device\textbackslash{}HarddiskVolume2\textbackslash{}folder
name\textbackslash{}filename.ext] [2010-01-23 23:34:56]}

\section{Question 4.6}
\textbf{Provide the registry key that contains the stubpath value and allows the
malicious software to persist after powering or reboot the system.
\\\\
Example answer format:
[HKLM\textbackslash{}Software\textbackslash{}subkey\textbackslash{}subkey\textbackslash{}subkey]}

\section{Question 4.7}
\textbf{Determine the file location of where the stolen documents have been
archived and what password was used to encrypt the archive.
\\\\
Example answer format:
[\textbackslash{}Device\textbackslash{}HarddiskVolume2\textbackslash{}folder
name\textbackslash{}filename.ext] [password]}

\section{Question 4.8}
\textbf{An additional backdoor has been deployed to the system and is persistent
after powering or reboot. Unlike the previous persistence mechanism, this
backdoor does not use the registry.
\\
\\a) What is the file location of the backdoor?
\\b) Name the process that is responsible for loading this backdoor?
\\\\
Example answer format:
[\textbackslash{}Device\textbackslash{}HarddiskVolume2\textbackslash{}folder
name\textbackslash{}filename.ext] [process name]}

\section{Question 4.9}
\textbf{Investigate the initial attack vector.
\\
\\a) What is the URI of the website that was responsible for the initial
exploitation of the computer?
\\b) What is the sender's email address that sent the malicious link to the
CEO's laptop?
\\\\
Example answer format: [http://sub.domain.com/website] [email@domain.com]}
